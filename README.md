## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When trying to style `<ul>` and `<ol>,` I learned that it sets the display to list-style. I was using Flexbox, and the bullets of the list would disappear.
